        <h2>Habits of Highly Successful People</h2>

        <p>Successful people are not born successful. They build their success through habits,
        discipline and strong mindset. Here are some habits you can start today:</p>

        <h3>1. They Wake Up Early</h3>
        <p>Early morning increases productivity and mental clarity.</p>

        <h3>2. They Read Every Day</h3>
        <p>Reading improves knowledge and sharpens the mind.</p>

        <h3>3. They Set Goals</h3>
        <p>Goals bring direction and focus to life. Without goals, there is no growth.</p>

        <h3>4. They Avoid Time-Wasting Activities</h3>
        <p>Successful people value time more than money. They avoid negativity and unnecessary distractions.</p>

        <h3>5. They Stay Consistent</h3>
        <p>Consistency is the real power. Small daily actions create big results.</p>

        <p><b>Final Message:</b> Start with one habit at a time. Consistency creates success slowly but surely.</p>
